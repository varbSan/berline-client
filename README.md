# Berline

**Berline** is a nightclub queueing web application.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to integrate and familiarize myself with my new tech stack. I fully acknowledge that this stack is over-engineered for the scope of this app, but the focus was on learning and experimentation.

## Features

Berline is a CRUD application where users can create queue points. The latest queue point is broadcasted via WebSocket, keeping users in sync in real-time.
